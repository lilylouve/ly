HAPPY  NEW YEAR!!!!!

I wish a blessed year for us and to be strong enough for everything
i hope we both grow and see each other happy and full of memories.
Don't repeat our past mistakes again and just change it in love.
Always think positive even you have big problems in life and don't forget
to try things hehe life is boring without experiences nga diba. Sometimes
its okay to cry love but don't forget to fight first. Secretly hide your success
to your parents because they not appreciate you at all and just prove it.
someday they will see your success if you reach it but always remember our parents get 
mad if we failed but they have no rights to judge us because even them experience to fail 
in life. I want you to grow on your own and decide everything coz of that maybe
you'll understand me. iloveyou ^_^
